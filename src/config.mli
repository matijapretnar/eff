    Unless specified otherwise, we look for pervasives.eff _first_ next to the
    executable and _then_ in the relevant install directory. This makes it
    easier to experiment with pervasives.eff because Eff will work straight
    from the build directory. We are probably creating a security hole, but
    we'll deal with that when Eff actually gets used by more than a dozen
    people. *)
