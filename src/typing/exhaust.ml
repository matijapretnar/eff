(* Pattern matching exhaustiveness checking as described by Maranget [1]. These
   functions assume that patterns are type correct, so they should be run only
   after types are inferred.

   Another assumption made by the code is that all types are inhabited by some
   values. An example where this matters is:

   let f x = (match x with) ; let (y, 42) = (x, 23) in y ;;

   Here we get a warning about non-exhaustive pattern match, but in fact
   since x has the empty type, the code will never execute (there is nothing
   we could pass to f). One solution would be to have the patterns explicitly
   typed, then we could compute whether the type is non-inhabited.
